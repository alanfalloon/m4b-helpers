This is a collection of scripts to help create m4b files.

The m4b extension is an Apple convention to indicate a standard m4a
audio file that contains an audio book. The m4a extension is another
Apple convention to indicate a standard MPEG-4 file containing AAC
encoded audio. The m4b files can also contain internal chapter marks
to allow internal navigation.

When loaded on to an Apple iPod, the m4b allows you to resume playback
from the last position, and allows you to skip between the chapter
marks within the file.

These scripts require at least version 1.6 of the mpeg4ip tools.

m4a2chaps.py
------------

This script reads the durations and titles of the m4a files on the
command line, and creates a text description of the chapter
information that is suitable to be used with 'mp4chaps -i'.

If you concatenate the input files into a single audio file, then this
would be the accompanying chapter information.
